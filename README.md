## Eligibility Declaration.  
**I hereby declare that I _have not_ held any prior paid job or paid internship.**  

---

## Why I am a good fit
I am applying for the 12-month full-time R&D internship at Synopsys (Noida) because my academic background, hands-on RTL projects, and system-level programming skills align strongly with the JD:

- **Strong foundation in C / C++** — implemented system-level projects and data-structure heavy modules; experienced in memory & file-handling optimizations.  
- **Exposure to Verilog & digital design** — designed and verified an 8-bit ALU and a digital IC trainer using Verilog (Xilinx ISE).  
- **Understanding of Computer Architecture & VLSI concepts** — coursework and projects on CPU building blocks, timing, and RTL design.  
- **Working knowledge of Linux** — daily use for development, simulation, and scripting (Ubuntu).  
- **Sincere, self-driven, and team oriented** — hackathon experience and team leadership in innovation competitions.

## Relevant Skills (keywords for screening)
**Languages:** C, C++, Verilog, VHDL, Python  
**Core:** Digital Design, RTL, Computer Architecture, VLSI Design, STA, Data Structures & Algorithms, OS fundamentals, Threading & IPC  
**Tools/Platform:** Xilinx ISE, ModelSim (if used), Logisim, LTSpice, MATLAB, Git, Linux (Ubuntu)  
**Other:** Basic familiarity with SystemVerilog concepts

## Key Projects (details + links)
- **ALU_8bit** — Verilog, Xilinx ISE. Designed and verified an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit implementing arithmetic and logical operations with RTL testbenches. (See: `PROJECTS/ALU_8bit_README.md`)  
- **Digital IC Trainer Kit** — Verilog & digital design. Built a trainer kit to experiment with gates, flip-flops, MUXes and sequential circuits; useful for validating combinational & sequential RTL blocks. (See: `PROJECTS/Digital_IC_Trainer_README.md`)  
- **TripEase (C++)** — Console-based system in C++ with OOP and file handling. Handled 1000+ booking records and optimized persistent storage & memory use. (See: `PROJECTS/TripEase_README.md`)
