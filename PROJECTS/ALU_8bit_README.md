# 8-bit ALU (Verilog)

**Technology:** Verilog, Xilinx ISE 14.7

**Summary:**  
Designed and verified an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit supporting add, sub, and/ or/ xor/ not/ shift operations. Implemented behavioural RTL and wrote testbench vectors to validate corner cases.

**Highlights:**  
- Implemented arithmetic and logical operations with control-coded opcode input.  
- Wrote testbench to validate carry, overflow conditions and operations across boundary values.  
- Synthesizable RTL verified on Xilinx ISE simulator.

**Note:** Original source code and testbench files are available upon request.

**What I learned:** RTL coding discipline, testbench creation, timing considerations and simulation-driven debug workflow.
